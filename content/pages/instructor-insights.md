Instructor Insights
-------------------

{{< quote "I decided to include a lot of demos during my lectures because I believe that to learn physics you have to know how to convert everything into mathematics, (…) make predictions, and, finally, compare predictions to experimental data. Demonstrations (…) show that the mathematics we cover in class (relate) to what nature does in physical systems." "— Yen-Jie Lee" >}}

Below, Professor Yen-Jie Lee describes various aspects of how he teaches _8.03 Physics III: Vibrations and Waves_.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class
--------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 27 sessions total.
*   Class sessions included lectures, demonstrations, and time to ask the professor questions.

Recitation
----------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 28 sessions total.
*   Smaller groups of students met with class staff to work through problem sets and to ask questions about the course material.

Out of Class
------------

*   Outside of class, students worked on problem sets and prepared for exams.
